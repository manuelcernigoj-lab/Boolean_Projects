    "Using libraries of your choice, scrape [this census page](https://www.census2011.co.in/city.php) and create a DataFrame called `cities` containing the first table from that page. *(Note: make sure to convert the variables `Population` and `Literacy` to numeric, you will need them later)*\n",

    "2. Merge the `cities` table with the `sps_fnd_loc` in a new DataFrame called `sps_fnd_loc_lit`. The resulting DataFrame is missing one row compared to the `sps_fnd_loc` dataset. Which `City` is missing? Figure out why and fix the problem. \n",
    "3. Looking at the new `sps_fnd_loc_lit` DataFrame, produce a scatterplot that shows `Literacy` on the x-axis, `Avg. Salary` on the y-axis and the `Population` as the size of the circles. Try also to add the `City` labels to each circle in the chart. There seems to be a positive direct relationship between the two variables (higher levels of literacy correspond to higher salaries), but there is one city that escapes this interpretation. Which city is it? Try to describe the chart and give your interpretation. "
